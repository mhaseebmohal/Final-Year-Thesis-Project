# Abstract

The rapid expansion of our built environment has necessitated the construction of high-rise multi-storey  buildings  to  accommodate  the  growing  population.  In  contrast  to  the  simple materials  used  in early  single-story  structures,  modern  construction  relies  on  Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) frames, encompassing slabs, beams, columns, and foundations. RCC combines  the  strength  of  concrete  with  steel  reinforcement,  making  it  the  best  choice  for structural integrity. 

Megastructures face numerous forces i.e., dead loads, occupancy loads, wind, rain, snow and earthquake  loads  which  need  to  be  carried  and  transferred  to  the  foundation  through  the structural framing. The numerous loads on the structure and their cumulative effect on the structure  as  governed  by  the  ACI/ASCE  codes  needs  to  be  evaluated  for  each  structural member to determine the required sizes and their reinforcements. The exactness of the analysis not only ensures safety but also brings cost-effectiveness to the construction. Considering the complexity of the analysis it is very difficult to analyse the large structures through manual calculations.  Therefore,  various  computer  programs  have  been  developed  over time  to streamline and reduce the cumbersome work of structural analysis, for example, Sap2000, Staad pro, Etabs etc., are commonly employed for this purpose. However, one notable limitation of these software is that they lack the Building Information Modelling (BIM) integration.  

Therefore, in this research project a relatively new software “Robot Structural Analysis” has been employed to carry out the structural analysis and design of a multi-storey building. The “Robot Structural Analysis” is a product of Autodesk, which is a leading solution provider in the field of civil engineering such as Autocad, Revit, Naviswork etc. 

This research focuses on modelling a 56 ft. high multi-story commercial building of five stories in Zone 2A and with the soil conditions of Multan Pakistan. After that, the structure is designed and analysed and this software’s analysis is checked through manual calculations. Software and manual results were appropriately the same.  It is observed that this is easy software in learning as it has a flat learning curve. We learned it in very better way, it is a very powerful software and due to BIM  integration,  all  its  content  can  be  easily  transferable  to  Revit.  It  is  an  advantageous software and is recommended to use.
